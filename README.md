Finding paths quickly from one wiki article to another. Goal is to paths quickly, not efficiently.

This was something I built for an interview. It works well, the techniques are solid, but overbuilt if you're just looking to solve the problem. I wanted to showoff a bit so I build a docker application, that hosts an api, uses muliple worker process, and has a small frontend, and caches results to quicker subsequent queries. Fun project.
